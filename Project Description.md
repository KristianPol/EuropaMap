## Project Overview

**This project will be made by Polimac Kristian, Malanyak Ostap, Mukhin Oleksandr**

We’re making the **European Map Website**! This website will have a map of Europe where you can click on any country. When you click a country, it will take you to a part of the website with info about that country, like its name, capital, population and more.

## Objectives
- To create a map of Europe that people can click on.
- To show important info about each country.
- To improve our HTML/CSS knowledge.

## Features
The website will include the following features:

1. **Homepage**
   - The homepage will have a big map of Europe. It will explain what the website is about.

2. **Country info**
   - **Things like a countries flag and a few photos of the country will be shown.
   - **There will also be a wikipedia link provided for each country if people want to see more about a country.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To build the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: To make the website look nice and presentable.

## Deliverables
- All the source code files for the website (HTML, CSS).
- Documentation that explains how we made the website.

## Submission Instructions
