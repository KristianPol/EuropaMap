# Report - Europa Map and Brochacho travel planner

## Done since last time

- Remade the Task manager into a travel planner
- Used json to store all the destinations and all the plans for each country
- Instead of clicking on a country to modify it, added a bootstrap widget
- You can mark plans to be done once you've done them

## Open problems

- The design is still lacking, and has to be improved
- Travel plans don't have a lot of details, they have to be still added
- Dark mode is somewhat broken and not avaliable to all webpages

## To do until next time

- Improve UI, give more options to tasks
- Fix dark mode
- Give the user an option to add locations to tasks and subtasks if needed
- Create a login/signup function and separate user data
