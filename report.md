# Report - Europa Map and Brochacho task manager

## Done since last time

- Added bootstrap to all websites
- Added menu to most websites using a javascript app, that automatically appends it to a website when it's code is used
- Created a web project: a time manager, that allows you to save tasks, which are stored in a json server
- Added the ability to modify those tasks using bootstrap modals
- Made a pomodoro timer: a timer that allows you to efficiently manage time alongside your tasks
- Added dark mode option for the Brochacho time manager

## Open problems

- The design is still lacking, and has to be improved
- Tasks are not sorted by the deadline, so it's a bit confusing for now
- There is no user login, so everyone can change the whole server, not just their own part

## To do until nest time

- Improve UI, give more options to tasks
- Rework dark mode in a more optimised way
- Give the user an option to take a break after finishing a task
- Create a login/signup function and separate user data
