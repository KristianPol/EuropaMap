# Report - Europa Map and Brochacho travel planner

## Done since last time

- Remade the Task manager into a travel planner
- Used json to store all the destinations and all the plans/expenses for each country
- Instead of clicking on a country to modify it, added a bootstrap widget
- You can mark plans to be done once you've done them
- Give budget to trips and how much you think specific plans will cost to see how much money tou have left

## Open problems

- Dark mode is somewhat broken and not avaliable to all webpages

## To do until next time

- Fix dark mode
- Create a login/signup function and separate user data
- Add ability to immediately plan a trip to a country via the interactive map
